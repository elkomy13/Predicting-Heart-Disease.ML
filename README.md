# Heart Disease Classification Project

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various medical attributes and data. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not, providing a valuable tool for early detection and prevention.

We're going to take the following approach:

Problem definition Data Evaluation Features Modelling Experimentation

Problem Definition In a statement,
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

Data The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease
There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset

#  Evaluation If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.

# Features

This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data

Create data dictionary:

age - age in years

sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)

cp - chest pain type :

0: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart

1: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart

2: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)

3: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease

trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern

chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl

serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides above 200 is cause for concern

fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes

restecg - resting electrocardiographic results

0: Nothing to note 1: ST-T Wave abnormality can range from mild symptoms to severe problems signals non-normal heart beat 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber

thalach - maximum heart rate achieved

exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest looks at stress of heart during excercise unhealthy heart will stress more

slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

0: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon) 1: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart) 2: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart

ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through the more blood movement the better (no clots)

thal - thalium stress result 1,3: normal 6: fixed defect: used to be defect but ok now 7: reversable defect: no proper blood movement when excercising

target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no) (= the predicted attribute)


Heart Disease Classification Project Workflow

# 1- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis is a critical step in understanding the dataset. This process involves:

  Understanding the dataset's structure, dimensions, and feature distributions.
  Visualizing relationships between variables to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential   outliers.
  Identifying missing values, handling duplicates, and preprocessing data for model training.
  
# 2- Model Training

  The core of this project involves training machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease. This phase includes:
  
  Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  Creating and training various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks) to learn from the data.
  Tuning hyperparameters and optimizing models to enhance predictive performance.
  Model Evaluation
  Evaluating the model's predictions using relevant evaluation metrics specific to the heart disease prediction task, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

# 3- Model Comparison

  Comparing the performance of multiple models to identify the most effective one in accurately predicting heart disease presence.

# 4- Model Fine-Tuning

  Refining the chosen model(s) further to enhance its predictive capabilities. This step involves techniques like feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, or employing ensemble methods for improved accuracy.

# 5- Feature Importance Analysis

  Determining the significance of different features in predicting heart disease. Identifying which attributes contribute most significantly to the model's predictions.

# 6- Cross-Validation

  Assessing the model's generalizability and robustness by employing cross-validation techniques to ensure its effectiveness on unseen data.

# 7- Reporting and Presentation

  Summarizing the findings, insights, and key results obtained throughout the project. Preparing a comprehensive report or presentation highlighting the dataset insights, model performance, feature importance,    and the overall project workflow.
